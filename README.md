# Advent of Code 2022

Traveling through https://adventofcode.com and trying to learn a bit of Rust.
This is a monorepo containing one binary for each day that I attempt to
complete.

# Setup

1. Install Rust following the instructions [on the website](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).
2. `cargo build` in the root dir to build the monorepo.
3. `cargo run -p <package>` to run the binary for a given package.For
example: `cargo run -p dec1`
